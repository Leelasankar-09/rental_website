# Vroom - Vehicle Rental Web Application

## Overview

Vroom is a web application for renting vehicles (cars and bikes). It allows users to browse available vehicles, view details, make bookings, and manage their rentals. The application features a user-friendly interface with a modern design and integrates with Firebase for data storage and user authentication.  An admin interface is also included for managing vehicle inventory.

## Features

*   **Vehicle Browsing:**  Users can view a catalog of available vehicles, with details such as model, specifications, and pricing.
*   **Vehicle Details:**  Each vehicle has a dedicated page with comprehensive information and high-quality images.
*   **Booking System:**  Users can select rental dates and book vehicles directly through the application.
*   **User Authentication:**  Secure user accounts with login and registration functionality.
*   **Admin Panel:**  Administrators can manage vehicle inventory, including adding new vehicles and updating availability.
*   **Responsive Design:**  The application is fully responsive and works seamlessly on various devices (desktops, tablets, and mobile phones).
*   **Modern UI:**  The application features a clean and intuitive user interface with a consistent design language.

## Technologies Used

*   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
*   **Styling:** Custom CSS with a modern design palette (defined in `styles.css`)
*   **Icons:** Font Awesome
*   **Database & Backend:** Firebase (Firestore for data storage, Firebase Authentication for user management)
*   **Potential Future Enhancements:**  (This section highlights areas for growth)
    *   Payment gateway integration for online payments.
    *   Advanced search and filtering options.
    *   User reviews and ratings for vehicles.
    *   Enhanced admin features (e.g., rental history, reporting).
    *   Progressive Web App (PWA) functionality for offline access.

## Getting Started

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   A web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
    *   A Firebase project (for database and authentication).
2.  **Firebase Setup:**
    *   Create a new Firebase project in the Firebase console.
    *   Enable Firestore and Authentication (Email/Password).
    *   Obtain your Firebase configuration object (API keys, etc.).
    *   **Important:** Update the Firebase configuration in your `script.js` file with your project's credentials.  (I will need to see your `script.js` to help with this step).
3.  **Project Files:**
    *   Download or clone the project files to your local machine.  (I assume you have a local copy of the project).
    *   Ensure all files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, assets) are in the correct directory structure.
4.  **Open in Browser:**
    *   Open the `index.html` file in your web browser. You should now be able to navigate the application.
5.  **Admin Access:**
    *   To access the admin panel (`admin.html`), you may need to implement login functionality and potentially restrict access based on user roles (administrator vs. regular user).  (This is a planned future enhancement).

## Customization

*   **Styling:**  Modify the `styles.css` file to adjust the application's appearance (colors, fonts, layout, etc.). The file uses CSS variables for easy customization of the main color scheme.
*   **Content:** Update the text content in the HTML files to reflect your specific vehicle offerings and branding.
*   **Images:** Replace the placeholder images in the `assets/` directory with your own high-quality vehicle images.
